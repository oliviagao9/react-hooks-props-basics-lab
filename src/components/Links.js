//Create a new component called Links. In this component, display the following:

//an <h3> element with the text of "Links"
//an <a> element with its href and text content set to URL of the user's Github link, passed down as a prop
//a second <a> element with its href and text content set to URL of the user's LinkedIn link, passed down as a prop
//Hint: make sure your <a> tags display the URL of the user's links as their text content so that it matches the demo image above

import React from "react";
